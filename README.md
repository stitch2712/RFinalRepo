Instructions for this file: 
The document: FinalProjectR.qmd has all the code and answers for the final Epi590 R Bootcamp Final Project. 
It has the clean dataset used for the analysis. I have another folder within my final project folder "outputs" that contains the output for my second "here" code. 

Summary of my data analysis: 
This analysis used data from Kaggle on Food Panda orders in Pakistan, containing `r nrow(orders)` rows and `r ncol(orders)` columns. The dataset includes information on customer demographics, order details, and transaction characteristics. The source is an open-access Kaggle dataset: Foodpanda Analysis Dataset 2025. 
This analysis helps one understand how food panda orders are related to demographic and food-ordering choices.
